#+title: Business Rules Erd Notes
* goals and reasoning for making this database
** goals copy any pasted from case study
- Are all suppliers delivering on time? Is there a large gap between expected
  delivery and actual delivery? A month by month report should show problem
  areas.
- The wine distribution, are all wines selling as they thought? Is one wine not
  selling? Which distributor carries which wine?
- Employee time. During the last four quarters, how many hours did each employee work?
- Maria would like their distributors to be able to order online, and to be able to track shipments.
